# jQ_CSS_Ticker
A plain jQuery + CSS animation that infinitely loops a text (e.g. newsticker). The animation runs on pure CSS! The jQuery function can easely be manipulated in order to in- or decrease the speed of the loop.

jQ_CSS_Ticker supports two or more tickers on a HTML-page, independent of the amount of list items.
